## Exploratory Data Analysis

### **1. Sales and Revenue Analysis**

- **Total Sales per Region**  
  The Central region has the highest sales, nearly doubling the average sales of other regions.
  Meanwhile, Canada has the lowest total sales at 48,755 compared to the average of 574,511 per region.

- **Sales Trends Over Time**  
  Sales consistently increased year-over-year, indicating growing consumer demand.
  However, there is a noticeable dip in sales from November to February each year, and a recurring drop in June.

- **Best-Selling Products**  
  The most purchased product category is **Binders**, with the top-selling items being:
  - Cardinal Index Tab, Clear (326 units)
  - Avery Index Tab, Clear (252 units)
  - Ibico Index Tab, Clear (251 units)
  
  On the other hand, **Machines and Tables** have the lowest sales. This could be due to:
  1. Their long lifespan, reducing frequent purchases.
  2. Higher pricing compared to competitors.
  3. Potential quality concerns leading to lower demand.

### **2. Profitability Analysis**

- **Total Profit Per Region**  
  Canada has the highest profit margin at **24.7%**, despite lower total sales.  
  Conversely, **Southeast Asia has a negative profit margin (-0.19%)**, meaning businesses there are experiencing losses despite total sales reaching 508,774.

- **Profitability by Product Category**  
  - **Paper** has the highest profit margin.
  - **Storage** has a moderate profit margin (11.87%) despite significant revenue.
  - **Tables** have a negative profit margin (-10%), likely due to low demand and high production costs.

### **3. Customer Segmentation Analysis**

#### **Consumer Segment Dominates**

The **Consumer segment** has the highest total sales at **24,457**, making it the primary target for marketing strategies.

#### **Corporate Segment in Second Place**

The **Corporate segment** recorded total sales of **14,238**, contributing significantly but still below the Consumer segment.

#### **Home Office Segment Has the Lowest Sales**

The **Home Office segment** has the lowest total sales at **8,630**, presenting an opportunity for targeted marketing strategies to increase sales in this segment.

### **Strategic Opportunities**

To boost overall revenue, businesses can:

- **Focus on Consumer Segment:** Since it generates the highest revenue, strengthening promotions and loyalty programs for individual customers can enhance sales further.
- **Develop the Home Office Segment:** Introduce tailored product bundles or targeted marketing for remote workers.

## Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are suggested:

1. **Regional Strategy:**  
   - If the goal is profitability, prioritize high-margin regions like **Canada, North Asia, and Central Asia**.
   - Evaluate pricing, operational costs, and distribution efficiency in **Southeast Asia** to address profitability issues.

2. **Customer Segmentation Focus:**  
   - Enhance marketing efforts for high-value customer segments.
   - Explore retention programs and personalized promotions for Corporate and Home Office customers.

3. **Inventory Management:**  
   - Ensure adequate stock for high-demand items like **Binders and Storage**.
   - Increase promotions for slow-selling products like **Machines and Tables**, possibly through bundling or improved quality.

4. **Cost Reduction Strategies:**  
   - Negotiate with suppliers to lower production costs.
   - Optimize supply chain efficiency to reduce unnecessary expenses.

5. **Product Promotion:**  
   - For **Tables (negative profit margin)**, consider **bundling promotions** with chairs or complementary products.
   - Improve product quality to increase customer trust and demand.

6. **Seasonal Sales Strategy:**  
   - Launch targeted promotions in **June** to counter the recurring sales dip.
   - Implement end-of-year campaigns such as **End-Year Sale or Christmas Sale** to boost sales from **November to February**.
